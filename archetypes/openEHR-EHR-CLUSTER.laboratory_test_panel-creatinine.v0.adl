LOINC	LongName	                                                   Component    Scale      exUCUMunits
2160-0	Creatinine [Mass/volume] in Serum or Plasma        Creatinine	   Qn	mg/dL
14682-9	Creatinine [Moles/volume] in Serum or Plasma      Creatinine	   Qn	umol/L

NB: This is not cloned in templates from laboratory-tests but specialized. The reason for this is that maintainability becomes hard when there are changes in the model, but the correspondending constraint can occur in more templates (which will happen because, ET decided to have archetypes which can occur in several templates.
