Creatinine or creatine anhydride, is a breakdown product of creatine phosphate in muscle. The loss of water molecule from creatine results in the formation of creatinine. It is transferred to the kidneys by blood plasma, whereupon it is eliminated by glomular filtration and partial tubular excretion. Creatinine is usually produced at a fairly constant rate and measuring its serum level is a simple test. A rise in blood creatinine levels is observed only with marked damage to functioning nephrons; therefore this test is not suitable for detecting early kidney disease. Creatine and creatinine are metabolized in the kidneys, muscle, liver and pancreas.

NB: This is not cloned in templates from laboratory-tests but specialized. The reason for this is that maintainability becomes hard when there are changes in the model, but the correspondending constraint can occur in more templates (which will happen because, ET decided to have archetypes which can occur in several templates.
