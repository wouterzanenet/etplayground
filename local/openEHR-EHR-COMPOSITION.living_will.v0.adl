Living will is also known as advance directive, advance decision, advance decision to refuse treatment, personal directive, advance healthcare directive, or medical directive. 

A person with capacity may create a living will document to record their wishes for medical care and treatment in advance, which is intended to guide decision-making in future situations in which the person is unable to make or communicate decisions. In some countries, a living will is a legally-binding document, while, in others, it may be legally persuasive without having an official legal status.

A living will is commonly used to refuse life-sustaining treatment which may include, but is not limited to, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), clinically assisted nutrition and hydration, artificial or mechanical ventilation, and antibiotics for life-threatening infections. 

This archetype has been specifically designed to hold the EVALUATION.living_will archetype with a nested living will details CLUSTER archetype, which will contain specific details of the living will as per national or other local requirements. However, this COMPOSITION can also be used to hold other types of archetypes where it is deemed appropriate.

In countries where a living will has legal status, it MUST be ensured that the EVALUATION.living_will archetype and nested living will details CLUSTER archetype adhere to the specific legal requirements.">
